Hi there, it's Thi. This site contains all of my notes for my personal learning. The language I use in this site is mainly in English but sometimes (the old notes) I use Vietnamese (or French for some parts).

Notes in this site are **only for me**, you thus don't understand what the hell I wrote sometimes. If you need to understand more or want me to explain something to you, don't hestitate to ask me in the comment below the post you are asking or here.

My English is really not so good (I think you can see it), but I am willing to improve continuously. Please let me know if there are some errors.

PS. I use **NoteTheme** (I modified form Matjek theme) for this note. If you wanna make another note-taking website like this for you, just read [this blog](https://dinhanhthi.github.io/NoteTheme/how-to-install-notetheme).
