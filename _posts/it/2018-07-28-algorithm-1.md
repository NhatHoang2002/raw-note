## Sorting

### Insertion sort

***Tìm + chèn giữa những cái trước***

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

 ~~~
insertionSort(arr, n)
Loop from i = 1 to n-1.
	Pick element arr[i]
	Insert it into sorted sequence arr[0…i-1]
 ~~~

![insertion sort](/images/posts/algorithm/insertionsort.png)

~~~ python
# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort
 
# Function to do insertion sort
def insertionSort(arr):
 
    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
 
        key = arr[i]
 
        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
        # greater than key, to one position ahead
        # of their current position
        j = i-1
        while j >=0 and key < arr[j] :
                arr[j+1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
        arr[j+1] = key
 
 
# Driver code to test above
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
insertionSort(arr)
print ("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print ("%d" %arr[i])
~~~



### Selection sort

***Tìm cái nhỏ nhất + đem ra trước***

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

1.  The subarray which is already sorted.
2.  Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

 ~~~
arr[] = 64 25 12 22 11

// Find the minimum element in arr[0...4]
// and place it at beginning
11 25 12 22 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[1...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[1...4]
11 12 25 22 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[2...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[2...4]
11 12 22 25 64

// Find the minimum element in arr[3...4]
// and place it at beginning of arr[3...4]
11 12 22 25 64 
 ~~~

~~~ python
# Python program for implementation of Selection
# Sort
import sys
A = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
 
# Traverse through all array elements
for i in range(len(A)):
     
    # Find the minimum element in remaining 
    # unsorted array
    min_idx = i
    for j in range(i+1, len(A)):
        if A[min_idx] > A[j]:
            min_idx = j
             
    # Swap the found minimum element with 
    # the first element        
    A[i], A[min_idx] = A[min_idx], A[i]
 
# Driver code to test above
print ("Sorted array")
for i in range(len(A)):
    print("%d" %A[i]), 
~~~



### Bubble sort

***so hai đứa đứng gần + lặp lại + lặp lại***

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

~~~ python 
# Python program for implementation of Bubble Sort
 
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
 
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
 
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
 
            # traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater
            # than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
 
# Driver code to test above
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
 
bubbleSort(arr)
 
print ("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print ("%d" %arr[i]), 
~~~



### Merge sort

***chia thành 2 nửa + sắp xếp từng nửa + merge lại***

~~~
MergeSort(arr[], l,  r)
If r > l
     1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:  
             middle m = (l+r)/2
     2. Call mergeSort for first half:   
             Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)
     3. Call mergeSort for second half:
             Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
     4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
             Call merge(arr, l, m, r)
~~~

![insertion sort](/images/posts/algorithm/merge-sort.png)

~~~ python
# Python program for implementation of MergeSort
 
# Merges two subarrays of arr[].
# First subarray is arr[l..m]
# Second subarray is arr[m+1..r]
def merge(arr, l, m, r):
    n1 = m - l + 1
    n2 = r- m
 
    # create temp arrays
    L = [0] * (n1)
    R = [0] * (n2)
 
    # Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
    for i in range(0 , n1):
        L[i] = arr[l + i]
 
    for j in range(0 , n2):
        R[j] = arr[m + 1 + j]
 
    # Merge the temp arrays back into arr[l..r]
    i = 0     # Initial index of first subarray
    j = 0     # Initial index of second subarray
    k = l     # Initial index of merged subarray
 
    while i < n1 and j < n2 :
        if L[i] <= R[j]:
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
        k += 1
 
    # Copy the remaining elements of L[], if there
    # are any
    while i < n1:
        arr[k] = L[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1
 
    # Copy the remaining elements of R[], if there
    # are any
    while j < n2:
        arr[k] = R[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1
 
# l is for left index and r is right index of the
# sub-array of arr to be sorted
def mergeSort(arr,l,r):
    if l < r:
 
        # Same as (l+r)/2, but avoids overflow for
        # large l and h
        m = (l+(r-1))/2
 
        # Sort first and second halves
        mergeSort(arr, l, m)
        mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
        merge(arr, l, m, r)
 
 
# Driver code to test above
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
n = len(arr)
print ("Given array is")
for i in range(n):
    print ("%d" %arr[i]),
 
mergeSort(arr,0,n-1)
print ("\n\nSorted array is")
for i in range(n):
    print ("%d" %arr[i]),
