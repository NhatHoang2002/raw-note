In this post, I would like to introduce to you the best list of softwares for Windows depending on your need. This list is built by myself, by my personal experiences. If you know any better app, please let me know on the comment section, I will try them and update the post if your choice is better than mine, thank you.

This list is updated very frequently. Mainly focus on Windows 10, if there are some apps also available on Mac or Linux, they will be mentioned also.

## Education

- **Multilanguages dictionary** : [Babylon 8](http://translation.babylon-software.com/) (paid, you should choose this version because it lists all lalanguages at the same time, later version will list each language on seperated tab, it’s harder to check). The best choice for free dictionary is [Goldendict ](http://goldendict.org/)because it can use babylon dictionary data. However, Goldendict cannot integrate sound pronunciation in it. On MacOS and Linux, Goldendict is the best choice. On Android, you can choose [Rapidict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rikkeisoft.rapidict2&hl=en) (best for Vietnamese users).

## Internet

- **French Conjugation** (and many other languages) : [Verbix ](http://www.verbix.com/)(free).
- **Free SFTP, SCP and FTP client** : [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php). It’s very better than [FileZilla ](https://filezilla-project.org/)because it has sync function between two folders. On MacOS, [Transmit ](https://panic.com/transmit/)is the best choice with the same features but it’s paid.
- **Control android phone on Windows** (the is a copied screen of android phone on your Windows screen) : [Vysor ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vysor/gidgenkbbabolejbgbpnhbimgjbffefm)(this is an extension on Google Chrome). It’s free with limited features.
- **Xtreme Download Manager** : Download nhanh, nhẹ cho Windows, free, [download](http://xdman.sourceforge.net/).

## Office

- **Markdown editor (WYSIWYG)** : [Typora](https://typora.io/). It’s also available on MacOS and Linux. Nhưng auto render trên Typora rất chậm, có thể thay thế bởi **[Abricotine](http://abricotine.brrd.fr/)** (toán ko tốt lắm nhưng được cái nhanh, free)
- **Convert tikz codes to figures** : [TikzEdt ](http://www.tikzedt.org/)(free, easy to use), you can also draw by yourself with this app.
- **LaTeX** : [Texmaker ](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)(free) + [Texlive ](http://mirror.ibcp.fr/pub/CTAN/systems/texlive/Images/)(free)

## Media

- **Music tag editor** : [Mp3Tag ](http://www.mp3tag.de/en/)(free)

## System

- **Virtual machine** : [VMWare ](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0)(free for personal uses). It is better than VirtualBox (I have tested with Ubuntu 14.04)
- **Disk partition** : [MiniTool Partition](https://www.partitionwizard.com/free-partition-manager.html) (free)
- **RegScanner** : scan automatically registry, phòng trường hợp bị dính spyware liên quan đến chrome. Free, [homepad](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/regscanner.html), [dự phòng](https://mega.nz/#!89x3mZLL!qCR28VWG9HpQUPFq984wRz22N8D9GxaTY5tsA-wOyLQ).
- **Remove Empty Directories** : tự động tìm và xóa đi các thư mục trống. Free, [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rem-empty-dir/).
