There are a lot of commands online ask you to do like "gem ....", you can run this command line in `cmd` or `Windows PowerShell`, however, first you need to install Ruby on your system.

Navigate to the [Ruby download site](rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). Download the version you want, then install it on your computer.

Restart your cmd or PowerShell, type the following command to see the current version of ruby

```
ruby -v
```

From now, you can use the command `gem` as you want, for example

```
gem install jekyll-extract-element
```
