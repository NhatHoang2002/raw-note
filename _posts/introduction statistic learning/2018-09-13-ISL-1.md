I use this note to archive everything I learn from the book **An introduction to statistic learning** by Gareth James. Note that, I read this book on a electronic version. So, there are many remarks I wrote directly on the pdf file.

{% include more.html content="[Read my ISL's pdf file.](/files/ISL_thi_notes.pdf) (available after I finish this book)" %}
