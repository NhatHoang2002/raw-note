Learn GIT from the basis. Learn how to use git with command lines and GUI softwares.

There are 3 main sites supporting git : [Github](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) ([comparison](https://stackshare.io/stackups/github-vs-bitbucket-vs-gitlab) between them). Github is very popular but there is no free private repository for you but bitbucket has. 

Github has a very powerful and easy to use desktop app. Bitbuket has one but it's not so good (I can't use it normally on my laptop). That's why I need to learn git from the beginning, especially by using command line so that I can use it anywhere I want even if there is no git client on some machine.

These are some [basic git commands](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html) from atlassian (a very close friend of bitbucket).

## How to use git with bitbucket?

1. Create an account on [gitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and create a repository, namely, "**1stproject**"

2. [Download and install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer.

3. Copy https link of the repository `https://dinhanhthi@bitbucket.org/dinhanhthi/1stproject.git`

4. Create a folder in your document where you will locate all your repositories, namely, **bitbucket**

5. Open PowerShell or command prompt and then tell git who you are

   ```
   git config --global user.name "Dinh Anh Thi"
   git config --global user.email dinhanhthimail@gmail.com
   ```

6. [Clone](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/getting-started-with-git-and-bitbucket-server-776640936.html) **1stproject** (you must enter the username and password at the first time to clone your repository)

   ```
   cd bitbucket
   git clone https://dinhanhthi@bitbucket.org/dinhanhthi/1stproject.git
   cd 1stproject
   git add .
   git commit -m "My first commit"
   git push origin master
   ```

7. Now, you can use your file manager to copy/paste files to folder 1stproject and then sync

   ```
   git add *
   git commit -m "Describe the changes"
   git push origin master
   ```
