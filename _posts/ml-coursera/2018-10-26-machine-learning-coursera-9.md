This note was first taken when I learnt the [machine learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).<br />
**Lectures in this week**: [Lecture 15](/files/ML-coursera/Lecture15.pdf), [Lecture 16](/files/ML-coursera/Lecture16.pdf).

[This note](/files/ML-coursera/note/) of [Alex Holehouse](http://holehouse.org/) is also very useful (need to be used alongside with my note).
