This note was first taken when I learnt the [machine learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).<br />
**Lectures in this week**: [Lecture 12](/files/ML-coursera/Lecture12.pdf).

- So far, we've seen a range of different algorithms
  - With supervised learning algorithms - performance is pretty similar. What matters more often is:
    - The amount of training data
    - Skill of applying algorithms
- One final supervised learning algorithm that is **widely used** - **support vector machine (SVM)**
  - Compared to both logistic regression and neural networks, <mark>a SVM sometimes gives a cleaner way of learning non-linear functions</mark>
  - Later in the course we'll do a survey of different supervised learning algorithms

## Large margin classification

### Optimization objective

- Alternative view of logistic regression: we see the cost function is a function of $z=X\Theta$.
- To build a SVM we must redefine our cost functions
  - Instead of a curved line create two straight lines (magenta) which acts as **an approximation to the logistic regression** $y = 1$ function
  - So here we define the two cost function terms for our SVM graphically

  ![Two new cost functions]({{img-url}}/svm-1.png){:.no-border .w-700}

  <div class="p-mark">
  $$
  \begin{align}
  cost_0 &= -\log(1-\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-z}}) \\
  cost_1 &= -\log(\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-z}})
  \end{align}
  $$
  </div>

- So we get (new **SVM cost function**)

  $$
  \min \dfrac{1}{m}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^m y^{(i)} cost_1(\Theta^Tx^{(i)}) + (1-y^{(i)})cost_0(\Theta^Tx^{(i)}) \right] + \dfrac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^n \theta^2_j
  $$

- We use another notation to minimize problem

  $$
  \min_{\Theta} C \sum_{i=1}^m \left[ \sum_{i=1}^m y^{(i)} cost_1(\Theta^Tx^{(i)}) + (1-y^{(i)})cost_0(\Theta^Tx^{(i)}) \right] + \dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \theta^2_j
  $$

- Unlike logistic, $h_{\theta}(x)$ doesn't give us a probability, but instead we get a direct prediction of 1 or 0 (as mentioned before)


### Large margin intuition 

- Logistic regression only need $X\Theta\ge 0$ to get $h=1$ or $X\Theta <0$ to get $0$. SVM gives us a clearer way ($X\Theta \ge 1$ and $X\Theta <-1$ respectively).

  ![Support vector machine]({{img-url}}/svm-2.png){:.no-border .w-700}

- Consider a case in which $C$ very huge, we need to choose $\Theta$ such that $A=0$ ($A$ in $CA+B$).
  - If $y1$, we need to find $\Theta$ such that $X\Theta \ge 1$
  - If $y=0$, find $\Theta$ such that $X\Theta <-1$
- When $CA=0$, the minimization problem becomes,

  ![SVM 3]({{img-url}}/svm-3.png){:.no-border .w-500}

- Mathematically, that black line has a **larger minimum distance (margin)** from any of the training examples

  ![Larger minimum distance]({{img-url}}/svm-4.png){:.no-border .w-500}

### Mathematics behind large classification

## Kernels

### Kernels I

- That a hypothesis computes a decision boundary by taking the sum of the parameter vector multiplied by a new feature vector f, which simply contains the various high order x terms

  $$
  \begin{align}
  h_{\theta}(x) &= \theta_0 + \theta_1f_1 + \theta_2 + \ldots, \\
  f_1 &= x_1, f_2 = x_1x_2, \ldots
  \end{align}
  $$

- We choose **landmarks** $l^{(1)}, l^{(2)}, \ldots$ and then using the **<mark>similarity</mark>** (_kernel_) between $x$ and each landmark $l^{(i)}$.

  <div class="p-mark">
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \text{similarity} = k(x,l^{(i)}) &= \exp\left( -\dfrac{\Vert x-l^{(i)}\Vert^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) \\
  f_i &:=  \text{similarity}(x,l^{(i)}).
  \end{align}
  $$
  </div>

  - $\sigma$: standard deviation
  - $\sigma^2$: variance.
  - $\Vert \cdot \Vert$: Euclidean distance

  $$
  \Vert x-l^{(i)}\Vert^2 = \sum_{j=1}^n (x_j-l_j^{(i)})
  $$

  - There are many **kernels**, above def of similarity is** Gaussian kernel**.

  ![Kernel and similarity]({{img-url}}/kernel-1.png){:.no-border .w-600}

  - We call $f$ landmark also!

### Kernels II

- Where do we get the landmarks from?
- For each example place a **landmark at exactly the same location**
  - Given $m$ examples of $n$ features $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}$ for $i=1,m$.
  - Choose landmarks: $l^{(i)} = x^{(i)}$ where $i=1,m$.
  - We will build $n$ landmark $f^{(i)}$, each of them is built from

  $$
  f_k^{(i)} = k(x^{(i)}, l^{(k)}), \text{ for } k=1,m.
  $$

- <mark>Note that</mark> $m$ input elements $x^{(i)}$ becomes $m+1$ landmarks $f$ ($f^{0} = 1$)
- $\Theta$ now becomes $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{(m+1)\times 1}$.
- $f\in \mathbb{R}^{(m+1)}$ also.
- <mark>Predict $1$ if $\Theta^Tf \ge 0$</mark>
- **SVM learning algorithm**

  <div class="p-mark">
  $$
    \min_{\Theta} C\sum_{i=1}^m \left( y^{(i)} cost_1 (\Theta^Tf^{(i)}) + (1-y^{(i)})cost_0(\Theta^Tf^{(i)})\right) 
      + \dfrac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^m\phi_j^2, \quad (n=m \text{ in this case})
  $$
  </div>

- We minimize using $f$ as the feature vector instead of $x$
- <mark>$m=n$</mark> because number of features is the number of training data examples we have.
- It's really expensive because there may be a lot of features (= number of training examples). <mark>It's good to use shelf software to minimize this function</mark> instead. DON'T write your own software to do that!!
- **Variance vs Bias trade-off**
  - Large $C$ ($\frac{1}{\lambda}$): low bias, high variance $\Rightarrow$ overfitting.
  - Small C gives a hypothesis of high bias low variance $\Rightarrow$ underfitting
  - Large $\sigma^2$: f features vary more smoothly - higher bias, lower variance
  - Small $\sigma^2$: f features vary unexpectedly - low bias, high variance

## SVMs in practice

### Using an SVM

- Don't write yourown codes to linearize the SVM, use already-writen library such as **liblinear**, **[libsvm](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)**, ...
  - Choice of $C$
  - Choice of kernel (similarly functions)
    - No kernel ("linear kernel", use $X\Theta$)
    - Gaussian kernel (above): need to choose $\sigma^2$
- <mark>Do perform feature scaling before using Gaussian kernel</mark>
- Not all similarity functions you develop are valid kernels $\Rightarrow$ <mark>Must satisfy **Merecer's Theorem**</mark> to make sure SVM packages' optimizations run correctly, and do not diverge.
- **Polynomial kernel**: 
  - use when $x$ and $l$ are both strictly non-negative
  - People not use this much.
  - parameters: $const$ and $degree$

  $$
  k(x,l) = (X^Tl + const)^{degree}
  $$

- Other kernels: string kernel (input data using texts, string,...), chi-square kernel, histogram intersection kernel,...
- <mark>Remember: choose whatever kernel performs best on cross-validation data</mark>

### Mul(Dclass*classifica(on

- Many packages have built in multi-class classification packages
- Otherwise use one-vs all method
- Not a big issue

### Logistic regression vs. SVM

- If n (features) is large vs. m (training set)
  - Feature vector dimension is 10 000
  - Training set is 10 - 1000
  - Then use **logistic regression** or **SVM with a linear kernel**
- If n is small and m is intermediate
  - n = 1 - 1000
  - m = 10 - 10 000
  - **Gaussian kernel** is good
- If n is small and m is large
  - n = 1 - 1000
  - m = 50 000+
  - SVM will be slow to run with Gaussian kernel
  - In that case
    - Manually createMul(Dclass*classifica(on or add more features
    - Use **logistic Mul(Dclass*classifica(onregression of SVM with a linear kernel**
Mul(Dclass*classifica(on
- Logistic regressionMul(Dclass*classifica(on and SVM with a linear kernel are pretty similar (performance, works)
- SVM has a convex optimization problem - so you get a 
- **Neural network** likely to work well for most of these settings, but may be **slower to train**.

## Programming Assignment

### SVM

- A large $C$ parameter tells the SVM to try to classify all the examples correctly. $C$ plays a role
similar to $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ , where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter that we were using
previously for logistic regression.

  </div>

- Most SVM software packages (including svmTrain.m) automatically add the extra feature $x_0 = 1$ for you and automatically take care of learning the intercept term $\theta_0$. So when passing your training data to the SVM software, <mark>there is no need to add this extra feature $x_0 = 1$ yourself.</mark>

### SVM with Gaussian Kernels

- To find non-linear decision boundaries with the SVM, we need to first implement a Gaussian kernel.
- You can think of the **Gaussian kernel** as a similarity function that <mark>measures the â€œdistance" between a pair of examples $(x^{(i)}, x^{(j)})$</mark>. The Gaussian kernel is also parameterized by a **bandwidth parameter**, $\sigma$, which determines <mark>how fast the similarity metric decreases (to 0)</mark> as the examples are further apart.
- **The Gaussian kernel function** defined as

  $$
  K_{Gaussian}(x^{(i)}, x^{(j)}) 
    = \exp\left( -\dfrac{\Vert x^{(i)} - x^{(j)} \Vert^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
    = \exp\left( -\dfrac{ \sum_{k=1}^n(x^{(i)} - x^{(j)})^2 }{2\sigma^2} \right)
  $$

- File **gaussianKernel.m**

  ~~~ matlab
  sim = exp( -(norm(x1-x2))^2/(2*sigma^2) );
  ~~~

### Example Dataset 3

File **dataset3Params.m**

~~~ matlab
range = [0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30];
predictionErrMin = 100000; % initial

for i=1:size(range,2)
   for j=1:size(range,2)
       model= svmTrain(X, y, range(i), @(x1, x2) gaussianKernel(x1, x2, range(j))); 
       predictions = svmPredict(model, Xval);
       predictionErr = mean(double(predictions ~= yval));
       if predictionErr < predictionErrMin
           predictionErrMin = predictionErr;
           C = range(i);
           sigma = range(j);
       end
   end
end
~~~

### Spam Classification

- You need to convert each email into a feature vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$. The following parts of the exercise will <mark>walk you through how such a feature vector can be constructed from an email</mark>.

### Preprocessing Emails

- One method often employed in processing emails is to â€œnormalize" these values, so that all URLs are treated the same, all numbers are treated the same, etc.
  - we could replace each URL in the email with the unique string `httpaddr` to indicate that a **URL was present**.
- Usually, we do:
  - **Lower-casing**: convert entire email to lowercase.
  - **Stripping HTML**: All HTML tags are removed from the emails.
  - **Normalizing URLs:** All URLs are replaced with the text `httpaddr`
  - **Normalizing Email Addresses**: with the text `emailaddr`.
  - **Normalizing Numbers**: `number`.
  - **Normalizing Dollars**: All dollar signs ($) are replaced with the text `dollar`.
  - **Word Stemming**: "discount", â€œdiscounts", â€œdiscounted" and â€œdiscounting" replace by `discount`
  - **Removal of non-words**: Non-words and punctuation have been removed. all tabs, spaces, newlines becomes 1-space character.

### Vocabulary List

- Our vocabulary list was selected by choosing all words which occur at least a 100 times in the spam corpus, resulting in a list of 1899 words. <mark>In practice, a vocabulary list with about 10,000 to 50,000 words is often used.</mark>
- Given the vocabulary list, we can now map each word in the preprocessed emails (e.g., Figure 9) into a list of word indices that contains the index of the word in the vocabulary list.
  - If the word exists, you should add the index of the word into the word indices variable.
  - If the word does not exist, and is therefore not in the vocabulary, you can skip the word.
- File **processEmail.m**

  ~~~ matlab
  for i=1:length(vocabList)
      if strcmp(str, vocabList{i})
          word_indices = [word_indices; i]; 
      end
  end
  ~~~

### Extracting Features from Emails

- You will now implement the feature extraction that converts each email into a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- $n=$ number of words in vocabulary list.
- $x_i\in \{0,1\}$ for an email corresponds to whether the i-th word in the dictionary occurs in the email.
- File **emailFeatures.m**

  ~~~ matlab
  x(word_indices)=1;
  ~~~
