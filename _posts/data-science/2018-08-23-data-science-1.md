## Differences 

### Data analyst, data scientist and data engineer

I found many paths on the internet to enter the data science's world. Most of them categorized into 3 types: *analyst - scientist - engineer*. I wanna find out the difference between them and what is the perfect fit for me. In this section, I am **not** an expert to answer this question **for you**, I noted this answer **only for me**.

- [Explanation on Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-analyst-data-scientist-data-engineer/).
- **Data analyst**: the bridge, the driver, from the past show the present.
- **Data scientist**: behind the scenes, from the past show the future.
- **Data enginerr**: the workers.

### Data science, data mining, big data

I heard alot about these these terms. 

- Get from a [Quora's answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-Data-Science-and-Data-Mining-are-they-same).
- From [simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-science-vs-big-data-vs-data-analytics-article): Data Science vs. Big Data vs. Data Analytics

### Learning platforms

- Datacamp vs Dataquest on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7gne17/which_one_is_more_effective_for_learning_data/)
