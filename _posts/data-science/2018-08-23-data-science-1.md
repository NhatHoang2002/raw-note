## Install

- Installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux) (to use pandas and other neccessary packages)
- Add Anaconda to PATH: `export PATH=/home/thi/anaconda3/bin:$PATH`
- If you have something strange, check this [note of python first]({{site.baseurl}}/python-note-1#install)

## Getting start

- [Loan prediction](https://github.com/dataquestio/loan-prediction) : an example of a <mark>finished project</mark>.
- <mark>The first step in creating a project is to decide on a topic</mark>. You want the topic to be something you're interested in and motivated to explore. It's very obvious when people are making projects just to make them, rather than out of a genuine interest in the topic.
  - Think about what sectors or angles you're really interested in, then find data sets relating to those sectors.
  - Review several data sets, and find one that seems interesting enough to explore.
- Some resources
  - [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) - A directory of government data downloads
  - [/r/datasets](https://reddit.com/r/datasets) - A subreddit that has hundreds of interesting data sets
  - [Awesome datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) - A list of data sets hosted on GitHub
  - [rs.io](http://rs.io/100-interesting-data-sets-for-statistics/) - A great blog post with hundreds of interesting data sets

## Differences 

### Data analyst, data scientist and data engineer

I found many paths on the internet to enter the data science's world. Most of them categorized into 3 types: *analyst - scientist - engineer*. I wanna find out the difference between them and what is the perfect fit for me. In this section, I am **not** an expert to answer this question **for you**, I noted this answer **only for me**.

- [Explanation on Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-analyst-data-scientist-data-engineer/).
- **Data analyst**: the bridge, the driver, from the past show the present.
- **Data scientist**: behind the scenes, from the past show the future.
- **Data enginerr**: the workers.

### Data science, data mining, big data

I heard alot about these these terms. 

- Get from a [Quora's answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-Data-Science-and-Data-Mining-are-they-same).
- From [simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-science-vs-big-data-vs-data-analytics-article): Data Science vs. Big Data vs. Data Analytics

### Learning platforms

- Datacamp vs Dataquest on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7gne17/which_one_is_more_effective_for_learning_data/)
